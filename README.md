# Invaders-Attack

When I started studying game development I wrote all sorts of different games, and at one point in my adventure I decided to try writing a clone of Space Invaders.

This project is not meant to be a uinque or serious project, it is just a project for a project-based learning. Hope the code will help others who also want to try to create something similar. 

I wrote this game in 2019, it took me two days (4 hours each day) and a month ago I did finishes and fixed some critical bugs.

I used some glue towards the end (;

Java Version: 8
Used *Swing Framework* for the graphics.
