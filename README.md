A game I have developed back in 2019, inspired by the retro game Space Invaders developed in the 70s. My game was written from the initial idea of developing a Space Invaders clone.

The game was developed in pure Java using the **Java Swing Framework** for the graphics.

How to play:

- Game controls: A/D (Right/Left), Space (Shoot).
