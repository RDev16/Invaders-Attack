# Simple-Space-Invaders-Clone

I wanted to do different experiments so I decided to take the game Space Invaders as a small project that took me two days to finish and try different things on it. The code started to mess up towards the end and I have already stopped investing in this project from two months ago already. Hope this source code will help someone in some way. Most of the code is well written and there are almost no bugs and the code is written in Java with Swing Framework.
